    Attributes:
        requests_to_load (dict):    A dictionary of web requests required for tests.
            Values within the dictionary are themselves dictionaries holding
            further information about the request.

                    'url (str)': The URL to load for this test,

                        specifying the minimum size in bytes that the response
                        should be.
                        If not be set, a default value is utilised.,
                        'method (str, optional)': A string stating the HTTP method
                        to be used by the request. Defaults to `GET`.
                        Additionally supports `POST`.,

        loaded_requests (dict):     A dictionary of web requests that have been loaded.
            The keys to this dictionary are the `test_name` keys from
            `requests_to_load`.
            The values are `Request` objects from the `requests` library.
        initial_num_urls_to_test (int): The number of URLs specified within this
            base class. Must not be overwritten by child classes.
            Used within a test to ensure the class is being inherited from
            correctly, with child classes defining their own requests_to_load.
